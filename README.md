This repository is my attempt at making a Habit Streak Counter application for GDSE Web Development induction task. 

I used the tradtional way of developing websites, that is to use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



This web application consists of the following functionalities:

-> Habit List: Users can maintain a list of habits and mark them as completed.

-> Streak Tracker: A visual tracker (e.g., progress bar or calendar heatmap) to indicate habit consistency.

-> Reset Mechanism: Automatically reset streaks when a habit is missed.



Instructions on how to use the app:

-> Click on 'Get Started'

-> Type the task you want to add in the input bar and click on 'add' to add it to the habit list.

-> Click on check button beside the habit afte you have completed doing it.

-> The streak bar shows your streak and renews everytime you skipped the habit for a day

-> You can click on the delete button beside the streak bar to delete the habit from the habit list.



Other details:

-> The data was stored locally on JSON files.

-> I have provided the explanation for various parts of the project in the code files itself

-> The resources that I used for the background and text:
